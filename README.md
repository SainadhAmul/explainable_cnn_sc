# explainable_cnn_sc
This project aims to address the issue of explainability in deep learning models, what the model is looking at while making a prediction, it becomes possible to diagnose biases, debug errors, and tune the model for optimal performance. This can be achieved through gradients or understanding feature importance in vision models.
